# Demos for Pytch

Each subdirectory within this `demos` directory corresponds to one
demo.  Within a demo's subdirectory, for example `smoothie-maker`,
there should be:

* a `dist` directory, laid out in the same structure as the zipfile
  downloaded from the webapp;

* a `src` directory (if required), where files such as Inkscape source
  files for costumes should live.
